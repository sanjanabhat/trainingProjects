Angry Professor

A Discrete Mathematics professor has a class of N students. Frustrated with their lack of discipline, he decides to cancel class if fewer than  K students are present when class starts.

Given the arrival time of each student, determine if the class is canceled.

Non Divisible Subset

Given a set, S, of N  distinct integers, print the size of a maximal subset,S' , of S where the sum of any  2 numbers in  S' are not evenly divisible by k.

Maximum Element

You have an empty sequence, and you will be given N queries. Each query is one of these three types:

1 x  -Push the element x into the stack.
2    -Delete the element present at the top of the stack.
3    -Print the maximum element in the stack.

Cut The Sticks

You are given N sticks, where the length of each stick is a positive integer. A cut operation is performed on the sticks such that all of them are reduced by the length of the smallest stick.

Suppose we have six sticks of the following lengths:

5 4 4 2 2 8
Then, in one cut operation we make a cut of length 2 from each of the six sticks. For the next cut operation four sticks are left (of non-zero length), whose lengths are the following: 

3 2 2 6
The above step is repeated until no sticks are left.

Given the length of N sticks, print the number of sticks that are left before each subsequent cut operations.

Note: For each cut operation, you have to recalcuate the length of smallest sticks (excluding zero-length sticks).
